class Flatland():
    """A random representation of the Flatland environment

    As stated in the assignment, the Flatland is a board generated randomly
    where 'each of the 10x10 squares, there is a 50% chance that it could spawn
    with food in it. If a particular square doesnâ€™t receive any food, there is
    a 50% chance that it could spawn with poison in it. Otherwise, the square
    remains empty. The agent starts in a random square.'

    Each cell of the board can have different values:
    - '.': an empty cell. Moving to it is an action with 0 reward.
    - 'F': a cell containing food. Moving to it has a reward of 4.
    - 'P': a cell containing poison. Moving to it has a reward of -1.
    - 'W': a wall. Running into a wall has a reward of -100 and stops the
    simulation.
    - 'A': the agent's position in each certain moment.

    Since walls are by default only out of bounds cells, the board should
    always be accessed through the method provided.

    Public variables:
    rows -- number of rows in the board
    cols -- number of columns in the board
    board -- board itself, as a 2D list of chars
    agent_x -- x coordinate of the agent in that moment
    agent_y -- y coordinate of the agent in that moment
    food -- list of food coordinates
    poison -- list of poison coordinates
    eaten_food -- list of already eaten food positions
    eaten_poison -- list of already poison food positions
